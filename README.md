EXERCISE 1 â€“ Add Authentication Logics

Objective:
â€¢	Add user registration and login routes using JWT.
â€¢	Secure routes so only authenticated users can access them.
â€¢	Update Swagger API docs to reflect authentication requirements.
â€¢	Reflect on the significance of token-based authentication in REST APIs.
Based on your W8 source code 
https://github.com/KimangKhenng/school-api

Q1: Create Authentication Routes

1.	Create POST /register route
ï‚§	Accept name, email, and password from the request body.
ï‚§	Hash the password using bcryptjs.
ï‚§	Store the user data (you can use an in-memory array or a database).


2.	Create POST /login route
ï‚§	Accept email and password from the request body.
ï‚§	Check if the user exists and the password matches using bcryptjs.
ï‚§	If valid, generate a JWT token using jsonwebtoken.
ï‚§	Return the token to the client.


Q2: Add JWT Middleware

3.	Create a middleware function to validate JWT
o	Extract the token from the Authorization header.
o	Verify the token using the secret key.
o	Reject unauthorized or invalid requests.

4.	Apply the middleware to protect existing routes
o	Example: Only allow access to /users if the JWT is valid.

Q3: Update Swagger Documentation

5.	Add JWT security scheme in Swagger setup
o	Define bearerAuth under Swagger components.securitySchemes.
o	Set it as a global or route-specific requirement.

6.	Document the following routes in Swagger
o	/register (no authentication required)
o	/login (no authentication required)
o	/users (JWT authentication required)
Q4: Reflective Questions (write your answers)

7.	What are the main benefits of using JWT for authentication?
    JWTs are stateless, meaning the server doesn't need to store user session information. This makes them highly scalable and perfect for modern, distributed applications and microservices. All the necessary information is in the token itself, which is verified cryptographically.

8.	Where should you store your JWT secret and why?

    You should always store your JWT secret in environment variables (like your .env file). This is critical for security because it keeps sensitive credentials out of your source code (e.g., Git) and allows you to use different secrets for development and production without changing the code.

9.	Why is it important to hash passwords even if the system is protected with JWT?

    They protect against different threats. JWTs authorize API requests for already logged-in users, while password hashing protects your users' actual passwords in the database. If your database is ever compromised, hashing prevents attackers from getting plain-text passwords, which they could use to access user accounts on other websites.

10.	What might happen if a protected route does not check the JWT?

    The route effectively becomes public. This would allow anyone on the internet to access, modify, or delete sensitive data without any authorization, leading to a major security breach. It's like leaving the front door of your house unlocked.

11.	How does Swagger help frontend developers or API consumers?

    Swagger creates interactive API documentation that serves as a clear, reliable contract between the frontend and backend. It allows developers to see every endpoint, understand its parameters, and even test API calls directly in the browser. This drastically speeds up development and reduces integration errors.

12.	What tradeoffs come with using token expiration (e.g., 1 hour)?

    It's a direct tradeoff between security and user experience.

    Short Expiration (More Secure): A stolen token quickly becomes useless. However, it's a poor user experience because users are forced to log in frequently.
    
    Long Expiration (Better UX): Users stay logged in longer, but a stolen token remains a security risk for a longer period.

    This is why many applications use a short-lived "access token" and a long-lived "refresh token" to get the best of both worlds.










EXERCISE 2 â€“ Implement React Frontend
For this exercise, you start with a start frontend and your backend code.
using the provided website as the preferred final result:
ðŸ‘‰ https://school-management-cadt.netlify.app/

Objective:
â€¢	Track and manage authentication state using JWT stored in localStorage
â€¢	Show/hide UI components based on whether a user is authenticated
â€¢	Implement login and logout logic
â€¢	Redirect users appropriately upon authentication status change
â€¢	Create a shared AuthContext for global access to auth state
Prerequisites
â€¢	React project bootstrapped (start source code is given)
â€¢	Basic familiarity with react-router-dom, localStorage, and React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)

Q 1: Set Up Auth Context
Learn the use of context: https://dev.to/dayvster/use-react-context-for-auth-288g
https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html

1.	Create context/AuthContext.jsx.
2.	Create a context with:
o	auth: current user (null if not authenticated)
o	setAuth: function to update auth state
o	loading: boolean to show loading screen if needed
3.	On mount, check localStorage for a JWT token and decode it if valid.
4.	Provide the context to the app in main.jsx.
ðŸ’¡ Hint: use useEffect(() => {}, []) to check token existence on page load.
________________________________________
Q 2: Utility Functions in utils/auth.js
Create these helper functions:
â€¢	isAuthenticated(): returns decoded token if it exists and is not expired
â€¢	logout(): removes token from localStorage
â€¢	getToken(): get the raw JWT 
â€¢	and more if needed
________________________________________
Q3: Show Navbar UI Based on Auth
1.	Open components/Navbar.jsx.
2.	Read the token from AuthContext.
3.	If user is authenticated:
o	Show their name or role
o	Show "Logout" button
4.	If not authenticated:
o	Show "Login" and/or "Register" links
5.	Implement logout button click:
o	Clear the token
o	Reset auth state
o	Redirect to /login
________________________________________
Q4: Implement Login Page
1.	Open pages/Login.jsx.
2.	Add a form with username/password (Done)
3.	On submit:
o	Send credentials to backend (mock API or working endpoint)
o	On success, store JWT in localStorage
o	Update auth state in context
o	Redirect to /dashboard or home page
ðŸ”’ Only store the token if login is successful.
________________________________________
Q5: Protect Routes Based on Token
1.	Create a wrapper component ProtectedRoute.jsx that:
o	Reads auth from context
o	If auth is null, redirect to /login
o	Else, render the children
// Example usage:
<ProtectedRoute>
<Dashboard />
</ProtectedRoute>
________________________________________
Q6: Auto Redirect if Already Logged In
â€¢	On the /login page:
o	If the user is already authenticated, redirect them to /dashboard automatically.


Reflective Questions

1.	Why do we use localStorage to store the JWT token instead of saving it in a React state? What are the advantages and risks?

2.	How does the AuthContext improve the way we manage user authentication across different pages?

3.	What would happen if the token in localStorage is expired or tampered with? How should our app handle such a case?

4.	How does using a ProtectedRoute improve the user experience and security of the application?

5.	What are the security implications of showing different UI elements (like "Logout" or "Dashboard") based on the token state? Could this ever leak information?
